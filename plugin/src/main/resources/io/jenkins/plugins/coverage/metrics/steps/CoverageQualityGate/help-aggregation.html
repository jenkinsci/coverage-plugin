<div>
    Defines how to aggregate the metric values for software metrics (e.g., cyclomatic complexity).
    <ul>
        <li><strong>TOTAL</strong>: Sum of all values (default)</li>
        <li><strong>MAXIMUM</strong>: Maximum value found in any method or class</li>
        <li><strong>AVERAGE</strong>: Average value across all methods or classes</li>
    </ul>
    This setting is only applicable for software metrics like cyclomatic complexity, cognitive complexity, and NPath
    complexity. For coverage metrics (e.g., line coverage), this setting is ignored and the aggregated coverage
    percentage is always used.
